# AI-learning-note
AI learning for very beginners. Aim to build an AI imperfect game that can interact with people.

-----
The first part is the learning note for machine learning on coursera. The learning note can be found under /notes for ML of Andrew-Ng/README.md, along with some slides(problem area only) and all the assignments. The content table is attached in order to make my notes clear and understandable.
